## Callbacks
A callback is a function passed to another function to run after a task completes. Think of it as a "call me back when you're done" instruction.

```javascript
function cookFood(dish, callback) {
  console.log(`Cooking ${dish}...`);
  setTimeout(() => callback(`${dish} is ready!`), 2000);
}
cookFood("Pizza", (result) => console.log(result));
